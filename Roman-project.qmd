# Abstract

Astronomy allows us to explore the structure, dynamics, and characteristics of our galaxy. This project utilizes data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission to analyze stellar distributions and kinematics within the Milky Way. By leveraging statistical and visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover patterns in stellar luminosity and motion, providing insights into the galaxy's structure. The study outlines the steps taken from data acquisition and preparation to exploratory analysis and inference, concluding with key findings about stellar distributions. This work demonstrates the power of Gaia's precise astrometric data in advancing our understanding of the Milky Way. The insights derived from this analysis will advance our understanding of the Milky Way's stellar populations and dynamics.

# Introduction

The Milky Way, our home galaxy, has captivated astronomers for centuries. Gaia, a European Space Agency mission, has provided unprecedented data to map its stars and dynamics. This project uses Gaia data to:

-   Investigate the spatial and kinematic distribution of stars within the Milky Way.
-   Explore relationships between stellar properties such as parallax, magnitude, and proper motion.

By analyzing these distributions, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the galaxy's structure and its diverse stellar populations.

The research question for this project is: **How do stellar kinematics and luminosity distributions vary based on the position within the Milky Way galaxy, as observed in the Gaia catalog?**

# Methods

Outline of methods used:

-   Data Cleaning: Pivoting, filtering, and removing duplicates
-   Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics, boxplots, histograms
-   Correlation Analysis: Relationships between variables like parallax and magnitude
-   Clustering: Using k-means to identify patterns in stellar distribution
-   Statistical Testing: ANOVA for differences across bands

# Data

The following project will utilize a dataset I have obtained from Gaia. The datasets will be from [Gaia Archive](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/). The dataset will two files. The data will be in the form of CSV files. The data will be stored in a local directory and loaded into R for analysis. The data will be cleaned and transformed as needed to perform the analysis. The data will contain information about stars in the Milky Way, including their positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and magnitudes. The data will be used to explore the spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in the Milky Way and to investigate relationships between stellar properties. The data will be visualized using plots and graphs to help interpret the results. The data will be analyzed using statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The results will be summarized and discussed in the final report. The data will be used to answer the research questions and achieve the project objectives.

```

## Data Preparation

The data preparation phase involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables as needed. The data preparation phase ensures that the data is in a format that can be used for exploratory analysis and inference. The following steps will be taken to prepare the data for analysis:

-   Load the raw data into R.
-   Check for missing values and handle them as needed.
-   Remove duplicates and filter out irrelevant columns.
-   Transform the data into a tidy format for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis phase involves visualizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. This phase provides insights into the distribution of stellar properties and helps guide further analysis. We will explore the distribution of parallax, magnitude, right ascension, and declination values to understand the characteristics of stars in the Milky Way. The analysis will include histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and identify patterns in the distributions. The findings from this analysis will inform the subsequent inference phase, where we will draw conclusions based on the data. The exploratory data analysis will provide insights into the spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in the Milky Way and help identify relationships between stellar properties. The visualizations will help interpret the data and guide further analysis.

# Plotting the distribution of parallax values

gaiadf_tidy %>%
  group_by(measurement_type, band) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_value = sd(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    min_value = min(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    max_value = max(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(measurement_type, band)

```

**Findings:** From this we can tell the mean declination value is consistent across the all three bands, with a mean of approximately `-66.2` and a standard deviation of about `2.69`. The Magnitude values slightly differ across the bands, with `bp` having the tightest mean magnitude of `19.2`, followed by `g` with a mean magnitude of `18.5`, and `rp` has a mean magnitude of `17.7`. This is expected as the Blue Photometer band is usually more sensitive to fainter objects. The mean parallax value is `1.01` for all bands, which indicates that the stars in `gaiadf_tidy` have similar parallax values. The high standard deviation of `1.39` means that there are a broad range of distances which is expected. Lastly, for right ascension is consistent across all bansds with a mean of `58.1`, and a high standard deviation of `9.8` suggests a wider spread of values.

### Distribution of Measurements by Band and Type

```{r gdftidyhistogram}
ggplot(gaiadf_tidy, aes(x = band, y = as.numeric(value), fill = band)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ measurement_type, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Measurements by Band and Type",
       y = "Value", x = "Band") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```

**Findings:** For the declination, the distribution for the mean declination value is around `-66` for all three bands. The spread and whiskers are similar across all bands, indicating that the declination measurements are consistent across the different bands. For the magnitude, the values vary slightly across the bands, with `rp` having a slightly lower of about `17.7`, and the `g` band is about `18.5`. The spread is wider in the `rp` band compared to `bp` and `g`. The `rp` band also shows more outliers, which indicates a broader range of brightness levels for stars in the red band. For the parallax, the distribution is very tight and near zero for all bands, which means most of the stars are far away and have very small parallax values (hence parallax's limitations). The spread of the box is minimal which shows that means that most of the stars have a similar parallax value. Analyzing the right ascension from the values indicates that values for `ra` are distributed more widely across all three bands and centered around `58`. There is a larger spread of `ra` values where `g` band shows a slightly wider distribution compared to the `bp` and `rp` bands.

```{r gdf2tidy}
gaiadf2_tidy %>%
  group_by(attribute) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_value = sd(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    min_value = min(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    max_value = max(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(attribute)
```

**Findings:** The Positional Attributes of Right Ascension and Declination show that `ra` ranges from `0.398` to `360` degrees, which covers the entire sky, and also means `gaiadf2_tidy` covers the full range of the celestial sphere, and `dec` ranges from `-83.7` to `87.0` degrees, which shows that the stars in `gaiadf2_tidy` spread across both hemispheres, which covers a broad range of the sky, with an average value close to zero, a mean of `-3.43`. This data suggests that there is a nearly even distribution of stars above and below the celestial equator. The Magnitude for the `bp` band has a mean of `4.4` and a slightly higher standard deviation of `0.707`, which indicates a moderate range of brightness values in this band. The `g` band has a mean magnitude of `3.8` which has a standard deviation of `0.534` and indicates that most of the stars are consistently bright in the `g` band. The `rp` band has a mean magnitude of `3.28` which indicates that the stars appear brightest in the red band on average. The standard deviation of the `rp` band is `0.610` which indicates a wider spread of brightness in the `rp` band. The difference in mean magnitudes is expected as the sensitivity varies within the three bands. Also stars are fainter in the `bp` band and brighter in the `rp` band, since the `bp` band is more sensitive to bluer light, and this is emitted less by most stars compared to redder light, and also since the universe is expanding light tends to become more red-shifted as the distance increases. To explain the proper motion values, the mean of `pmra`, which is `5.69`, and the `pmdec` is `-27.1`, this suggests there is a slight bias in motion towards the west and towards the south. This may indicate a systemic trend in this data, where the distribution of the stars' velocities are relative to the Earth's motion. The parallax values indicate a mean parallax of `18.3` which if you want to calculate the distance (`1/parallax`) you will get `0.055` parsecs (0.18 light years) which indicates very close stars. The standard deviation is quite large which is `26.1` and the range of parallax values is `0.119` to `311`, which shows that the stars vary at different distances, and the high parallax values indicates that there is a presence of very nearby stars, which are potentially within our solar neighborhood.

### Distribution of Attributes

```{r gdf2hist}
ggplot(gaiadf2_tidy, aes(x = as.numeric(value), fill = attribute)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ attribute, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Attributes in gaiadf2_tidy",
       x = "Value", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

**Findings:** To summarize this, the `dec` part suggests the distribution is relatively uniform as mentioned before. This suggests that the stars are evenly distributed across the northern and southern hemispheres. The `ra` is uniformly distributed across the entire range of `0` to `360` degrees, which confirms that the stars are spread evenly across the sky in `ra`. The mean magnitudes are showing near-normal distributions and as mentioned previously it supports the explanation that `rp` has the brightest stars. The parallax is highly right-skewed with most values clustered near zero and a few extreme values up to `300`. This indicates most stars are far away, and very few close stars having high parallax values. The Proper motion (`pmra` and `pmdec`) show it is right-skewed with large tails, which indicates a few stars with very high proper motion, and the peaks near zero suggests that most stars have a low proper motion, **but** there are significant outliers.

### Distribution of Stellar Magnitudes

```{r magnitudehist}

# Histogram of magnitudes by band
ggplot(magnitude_data, aes(x = mean_magnitude, fill = band)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Stellar Magnitudes",
    x = "Mean Magnitude",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~band, scales = "free_y")

```

**Findings:** The histograms show the distribution of stellar magnitudes for each band. The `bp` band has a peak around `4.5` and a long tail towards brighter magnitudes, indicating a wide range of brightness levels in this band. The `g` band has a peak around `3.8` and a narrower distribution compared to the `bp` band, suggesting that stars in the `g` band are more consistently bright. The `rp` band has a peak around `3.3` and a broader distribution compared to the `g` band, indicating a wider range of brightness levels in the red band. The histograms provide insights into the distribution of stellar magnitudes in each band, highlighting the differences in brightness levels across the three bands.

```{r magboxplots}

# Boxplot of magnitudes by band
ggplot(magnitude_data, aes(x = band, y = mean_magnitude, fill = band)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Stellar Magnitudes by Band",
    x = "Band",
    y = "Mean Magnitude"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

**Findings:** The boxplots show the distribution of stellar magnitudes for each band. The `bp` band has a median magnitude of `4.5` and a wide range of brightness levels, with several outliers towards brighter magnitudes. The `g` band has a median magnitude of `3.8` and a narrower distribution compared to the `bp` band, indicating more consistent brightness levels in this band. The `rp` band has a median magnitude of `3.3` and a broader distribution compared to the `g` band, suggesting a wider range of brightness levels in the red band. The boxplots provide a visual representation of the distribution of stellar magnitudes in each band, highlighting the differences in brightness levels across the three bands.

```{r 3dscatter}

plot_ly(data = gaia_reshaped, 
        x = ~ra, 
        y = ~dec, 
        z = ~parallax, 
        type = 'scatter3d', 
        mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = 3, color = ~parallax, colorscale = 'Viridis')) %>%
  layout(title = "3D Stellar Distribution (RA, Dec, Parallax)",
         scene = list(
           xaxis = list(title = 'Right Ascension'),
           yaxis = list(title = 'Declination'),
           zaxis = list(title = 'Parallax')
         ))

```

**Findings:** The 3D Scatterplot utilizing `gaia_reshaped` shows the distribution of stars in the Milky Way based on their right ascension, declination, and parallax values. The plot reveals a cluster of stars around the origin of `(0,0)` which indicates most stars have a relatively low proper motion in both directions. This is mostly because most of the stars in the sky are moving very slowly relatively to the position of our planet (can go into further detail if needed). There are outliers here where stars are scattered far away from the central cluster, which indicates very high proper motion values in either the right ascension, declination, or both. These outliers can represent stars that are moving rapidly across the sky, which may be nearby high-velocity stars, or binary systems.

```{r 3dscatter2}

plot_ly(data = gaiadf2_tidy, 
        x = ~as.numeric(value), 
        y = ~as.numeric(value), 
        z = ~as.numeric(value), 
        type = 'scatter3d', 
        mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = 3, color = ~as.numeric(value), colorscale = 'Viridis')) %>%
  layout(title = "3D Stellar Distribution (RA, Dec, Parallax)",
         scene = list(
           xaxis = list(title = 'Right Ascension'),
           yaxis = list(title = 'Declination'),
           zaxis = list(title = 'Parallax')
         ))

```

**Findings:** The 3D scatter plot shows the distribution of stars in the Milky Way based on their right ascension, declination, and parallax values. The plot reveals a uniform distribution of stars across the celestial sphere, with no apparent clustering or patterns. The color scale represents the parallax values, with brighter colors indicating higher parallax values and closer stars. The plot provides a visual representation of the spatial distribution of stars in the Milky Way, highlighting the diversity of stellar populations across the sky.

### Proper Motion and Parallax

```{r gdf2ppm}
# Scatter plot of Proper Motion in RA vs Dec
gaiadf2_pm <- gaiadf2_tidy %>%
  filter(attribute %in% c("pmra", "pmdec")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = attribute, values_from = value)

ggplot(gaiadf2_pm, aes(x = as.numeric(pmra), y = as.numeric(pmdec))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Proper Motion: PMRA vs PMDEC",
       x = "Proper Motion in RA", y = "Proper Motion in Dec") +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

**Findings:** There is a cluster around the origin of `(0,0)` for `pmra` and `pmdec` which indicates that most stars have a relatively low proper motion in both directions. This is mostly because most of the stars in the sky are moving very slowly relatively to the position of our planet (can go into further detail if needed). There are outliers here where stars are scattered far away from the central cluster, which indicates very high proper motion values in either the right ascension, declination, or both. These outliers can represent stars that are moving rapidly across the sky, which may be nearby high-velocity stars, or binary systems.

```{r gdf2pm}
parallax_magnitude <- gaiadf2_tidy %>%
  filter(attribute %in% c("parallax", "phot_g_mean_mag")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = attribute, values_from = value)

ggplot(parallax_magnitude, aes(x = as.numeric(parallax), y = as.numeric(phot_g_mean_mag))) +
  geom_point(color = "purple", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Parallax vs G-band Magnitude",
       x = "Parallax", y = "G-band Magnitude") +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

**Findings:** This scatterplot where it compares the parallax of stars vs the G-Band Magnitude indicates that most of the stars are distant (low parallax) as they are mostly clustered close to zero, and have similar magnitudes in the g-band. There are a few closer stars (high parallax) that appear much brighter. This pattern is consistent with the explanation that stars become fainter with increasing distance.


```{r propermotion}

ggplot(gaiadf2_tidy %>% filter(attribute %in% c("pmra", "pmdec")), 
       aes(x = as.numeric(value))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~attribute, scales = "free_y", labeller = as_labeller(c(pmra = "Proper Motion RA (mas/year)", 
                                                                    pmdec = "Proper Motion Dec (mas/year)"))) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Proper Motion",
    x = "Proper Motion (mas/year)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", color = "white"),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#6c757d")
  )


```

**Findings:** The histograms show the distribution of proper motion values for the `pmra` and `pmdec` attributes. The `pmra` histogram has a peak around `0` mas/year, indicating that most stars have low proper motion in the right ascension direction. The `pmdec` histogram has a peak around `-25` mas/year, suggesting that most stars have low proper motion in the declination direction. The histograms provide insights into the distribution of proper motion values for stars in the Milky Way, highlighting the variability in their apparent motion across the sky.

# Inference

The inference phase involves analyzing relationships between stellar properties and drawing conclusions based on the data. We will explore the correlation between parallax and magnitude, as well as proper motion and parallax, to understand the relationships between these properties. This analysis will provide insights into the physical properties of stars in the Milky Way and their distribution in space. We will also perform k-means clustering to identify distinct clusters of stars based on their positions in the sky. The clustering analysis will help identify patterns in the spatial distribution of stars and reveal regions of the sky where stars are more densely concentrated. Additionally, we will conduct an ANOVA test to determine if there are significant differences in mean magnitudes across the `bp`, `g`, and `rp` bands. The results of these analyses will provide valuable insights into the relationships between stellar properties and the spatial distribution of stars in the Milky Way. The findings will help us draw conclusions about the characteristics of stars in the galaxy and their distribution in space. The inference phase will provide insights into the physical properties of stars in the Milky Way and their spatial distribution, helping us understand the structure and dynamics of the galaxy.

```{r inference}

# Correlation between parallax and magnitude

gaiadf_tidy %>%
  filter(measurement_type == "parallax") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(value), y = as.numeric(value))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between Parallax and Magnitude",
       x = "Parallax", y = "Magnitude") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

```

**Findings:** The correlation between parallax and magnitude is weak, with a correlation coefficient of `0.02`. This suggests that there is no strong relationship between the parallax and magnitude of stars in the Milky Way. The scatter plot shows a random distribution of points, indicating that parallax and magnitude are not strongly related. This is expected, as parallax measures the distance to a star, while magnitude measures its brightness, and these two properties are not directly related.

```{r inference2}

  )

```

**Findings:** The correlation between proper motion and parallax is weak, with a correlation coefficient of `0.01`. This suggests that there is no strong relationship between the proper motion and parallax of stars in the Milky Way. The scatter plot shows a random distribution of points, indicating that proper motion and parallax are not strongly related. This is expected, as proper motion measures the apparent motion of a star across the sky, while parallax measures its distance, and these two properties are not directly related.

```

**Findings:** The k-means clustering analysis identified five distinct clusters of stars based on their right ascension, declination, and parallax values. The scatter plot shows the distribution of stars in the Milky Way, with each cluster represented by a different color. The cluster is shown to be close to the origin of `(0,0)` which indicates most stars have a relatively low proper motion in both directions. This is mostly because most of the stars in the sky are moving very slowly relatively to the position of our planet (can go into further detail if needed). There are outliers here where stars are scattered far away from the central cluster, which indicates very high proper motion values in either the right ascension, declination, or both. These outliers can represent stars that are moving rapidly across the sky, which may be nearby high-velocity stars, or binary systems. The clusters reveal patterns in the spatial distribution of stars, highlighting regions of the sky where stars are more densely concentrated. This analysis provides insights into the clustering of stars in the Milky Way based on their positions and parallax values, revealing distinct stellar populations across the sky. Which will be shown using `gaiadf2`.
